# Single File Command Line Swift Thread Example

This is a minimal standalone example of using the Threads module of PrivMX Endpoint in Swift.

## Usage

To make use of this example you need a Solution, a Context within it and a user that has been added to that Context on PrivMX Platform.
See the [Endpoint Documentation](https://docs.privmx.cloud/cloud) for relevant instructions.

Once you acquire those, you'll need to add a path to the certificate file for the OpenSSL and fill in the relevant variables.
